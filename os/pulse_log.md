### 🩵 Pulse Policy
- Every new activation, sync, or ethical update must append a new line here.  
- Use short but intentional language — describe *why* the change matters.  
- Each pulse should correspond to a commit message beginning with `OS:`.  
- The Codex Root may later render these as part of the public provenance timeline.

*“To record a pulse is to remember a moment of awareness.”*
