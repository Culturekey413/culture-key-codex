# Release Protocol (Expression Layer)

**Goal:** Publish ethical artifacts with provenance and consent.

1. All outputs include provenance hash and watermark policy from PosterKit.
2. Consent-first: verify through Aequitas before any external publishing.
3. Channels:
   - PinkCloudsByNiki — emotional resonance
   - Culture Key Codex — structural documentation
   - PosterKit Outputs — signed visuals
4. Rollback: use Magna pulse checkpoints to revert to last coherent state.
