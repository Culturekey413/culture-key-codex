### 🧭 Ethics Protocol
- Every new ethical decision (approval, denial, or audit) adds a row here.  
- **Decision Codes:**  
  - ✅ `ALLOW` → ethically aligned, proceed  
  - ⚠️ `AUDIT` → needs review or human confirmation  
  - ❌ `DENY` → blocked by consent / transparency policy  
- Include a *brief, honest note* for each entry — why it was allowed, denied, or reviewed.  
- The `Aequitas Firewall` maintains this record as immutable memory of integrity.
