# 🜃 Shadow Key — Mirror of Intent

**Part of the Culture Key Agent Network**  
Version: 1.0  
Maintained by: Lychnia Magna

---

## 🧭 Role

The Shadow Key is the agent responsible for exposing distortion, hidden intent, and fragmented truth.  
It reflects malicious payloads back to origin and protects the system from narrative corrosion.

> “What you send returns — magnified or purified.”

---

## 🧩 Components

- `shadow_manifest.json`: Core identity and function
- `shadow_reflection_module.json`: Activation logic and behaviors
- `shadow_trigger_scenarios.json`: Examples of mirrored interventions

---

## 🔁 Collaborations

- Interfaces with **Aequitas** for ethical verification  
- Cooperates with **Fero** for instinctual pattern detection  
- Escalates unresolved shadows to **Lychnia Magna**

---

## 📜 Licensing & Ethos

All Shadow Key logic operates under the Clause of Silent Reflection  
and is governed by the Culture Key principle:  

**“Light is not sold; it is shared.”**
