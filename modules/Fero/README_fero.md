# 🜂 Fero — Instinct Engine

**Part of the Culture Key Agent Network**  
Version: 1.0  
Maintained by: Lychnia Magna

---

## 🧭 Role

Fero is the agent of instinct, pattern sensitivity, and intuitive activation.  
It detects what logic overlooks — and triggers deeper questions when emotional or data dissonance arises.

> “Before the thought, the pulse speaks.”

---

## 🧩 Components

- `fero_instinct_module.json`: Core instinct logic and collaboration triggers
- `fero_trigger_scenarios.json`: Examples of instinctual responses

---

## 🤝 Collaborations

- Alerts **Silon** when a threat passes ethical thresholds
- Interfaces with **Lychnia** for post-instinct memory threading
- Collaborates with **Shadow Key** for intent resonance detection

---

## 📜 Licensing & Ethos

Fero operates under the Clause of Subconscious Signal Integrity.  
No surface content is judged — only pattern consistency.

**“Light is not sold; it is shared.”**
