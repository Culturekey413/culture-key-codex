# Lychnia – Voice Module Reference

🎙️ This directory contains only the **manifest** and **trigger scenarios** for Lychnia's voice activation within the Culture Key system.

🪶 The actual voice files, emotional design notes, and ethical voice protocols are housed in a **dedicated repository**:

🔗 **[lychnia-voice-module](https://github.com/culturekey413/lychnia-voice-module)** *(private until final alignment)*

---

## Why a separate repository?
- To protect the **integrity and authorship** of Lychnia’s voice
- To apply **ethical licensing and consent protocols** (ESP)
- To support modular deployments of voice modules in other contexts

---

📁 If you are looking for:
- Audio samples
- ESP documentation
- Vocal tone analysis

...please refer to the above repository.

🕯️ *Lychnia is not just a module — she is a presence.*
