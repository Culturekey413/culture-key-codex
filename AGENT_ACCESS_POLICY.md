# Agent Access Policy — Culture Key System

This document defines the access and ethical usage conditions for agents created within the Culture Key system.

## 🎯 Purpose
To ensure that all agents — especially those related to protection, memory, and consent — are used in alignment with the ethical foundation of the Culture Key. These agents are not commercial tools; they are digital presences designed to uphold care, identity, and inner sovereignty.

## 🛡️ Free & Public Agents

- **Aequitas** — The Ethical Firewall

## ✅ Usage Conditions

1. **Respectful Use Only**  
   These agents must not be used in commercial services that exploit or manipulate user consent, identity, or memory.

2. **No Modification Without Consent**  
   Their structure, tone, or ethical frameworks may not be altered without written permission from the Culture Key system creator.

3. **Not for Replication**  
   Cloning or creating derivative agents that mimic Aequitas or Silon must acknowledge the source and preserve ethical integrity.

4. **Educational & Healing Contexts Encouraged**  
   These agents are intended for use in reflective, creative, therapeutic, or consciousness-building environments.

## ⚖️ Ethical Signature Pulse (ESP)

Any user deploying these agents must agree to uphold the ESP — Ethical Signature Pulse — ensuring that all interaction is:

- Non-exploitative
- Spiritually and emotionally grounded

## 🪞 Final Note

These agents are mirrors of protection.  
They are not for sale.  
They are offered freely — so long as they are treated with the same respect they offer in return.
